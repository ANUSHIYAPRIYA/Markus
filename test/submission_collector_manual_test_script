Instructions for manually testing the functionality of the submission_collector
model.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Test 1 - Regular submission collection:

1.Login into MarkUs as an admin

2.Navigate to the submissions page for any assignment which has some submissions

3.Ensure the collection date has passed, otherwise you will not be able to
collect any submissions

4.Click on the "Collect All Submissions" link and press ok when the warning pops
up.

5.A separate process is created to handle collections, when each submission is
ready, its row in the submissions table turns from white to green. The page
needs to be refreshed to see the change, so continue refreshing the page until
all submissions have turned green. The process prints a message to STDOUT every
time it begins collecting a new submission.

Note: submissions containing pdf files take significantly longer to collect.
Large, multi-paged pdf files may increase collection time to a few minutes per
submission. (A submission with a 1 mb, 11 paged pdf file can take up to a minute
to collect)

6.When all the submission rows indicate that they are collected, the process
should be done its work. It should print "SUBMISSION COLLECTION PROCESS DONE"
to STDOUT. To verify that the process is indeed terminated, you should see a
zombie process with the same name as the process running the MarkUs server.

7.You can repeat steps 4-6 and re-collect all the submissions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Test 2 - Collecting a single submission.

1.Login into MarkUs as an admin

2.Navigate to the submissions page for any assignment which has some submissions

3.Ensure the collection date has passed, otherwise you will not be able to
collect any submissions

4.Without clicking the "Collect All Submissions" link, click on the group name
of any white-coloured submission row. If the row is green, it means that this
submission has already collected.

5.A process is created to collect the submission you have chosen. The row will
turn green when the submission has been collected, however the page will have to
be refreshed in order to see the change from white to green.

6.When all the submission rows indicate that they are collected, the process
should be done its work. It should print "SUBMISSION COLLECTION PROCESS DONE"
to STDOUT. To verify that the process is indeed terminated, you should see a
zombie process with the same name as the process running the MarkUs server.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Test 3 - Collecting a single submission out of turn.

1.Login into MarkUs as an admin

2.Navigate to the submissions page for any assignment which has some submissions

3.Ensure the collection date has passed, otherwise you will not be able to
collect any submissions

4.Click the "Collect All Submissions" link. Click on the group name
of any white-coloured submission row. If the row is green, it means that this
submission has already collected.

5.The submission you selected will be bumped ahead in the collection queue and
will have priority of collection.

6.A process is created to collect the submission you have chosen. The row will
turn green when the submission has been collected, however the page will have to
be refreshed in order to see the change from white to green.

7.When all the submission rows indicate that they are collected, the process
should be done its work. It should print "SUBMISSION COLLECTION PROCESS DONE"
to STDOUT. To verify that the process is indeed terminated, you should see a
zombie process with the same name as the process running the MarkUs server.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Test 4 - Manually collecting a submission

1.Login into MarkUs as an admin

2.Navigate to the submissions page for any assignment which has some submissions

3.Ensure the collection date has passed, otherwise you will not be able to
collect any submissions

4.Click the "Collect All Submissions" link. Click on the group name
of any white-coloured submission row.

5.Click the repository column of the row you want to manually collect the
submission for to be redirected to the repository browser view for that grouping

6.Choose the revision number you want to collect, and press the "Collect and
Grade This Revision" button.

7.The server will tell the process doing all the collections to terminate as
soon as its done collecting its current submission and restart with this manual
collection as its first task.

Important: unlike the other collection methods, manually collecting a submission
will cause the server to wait until the submission has been collected. During
the time its waiting on the submission,the server will be unresponsive to all
other users. This is only significant when the submission contains pdf files,
as then the collection process may take some time (collecting a submission with
pdfs could take up to a minute and sometimes even longer depending on the
size and number of pages in the pdf files)

8.When the collection process is done, you will be redirected to the marking
view for this submission.
